# phpCrud
Make a OOP PHP crud operations with different patterns and tests


How it works:
         It may receive values by all methods, POST or GET, ant it have a series of variables which defines its behavior:<br/>
         localhost project URL+ ==>> index.php?st=a&name=4furious&yy=2012&co=MPVolt<br/>
         here we will be using GET method by fast and easy to test results<br/>
         In the url GET vars "st" defines operation st=a means add to database<br/>
         Later it will add to database with this string st=a&name=4furious&yy=2012&co=MPVolt<br/>
         name=4furious<br/>
         yy=2012 for year of launch the game<br/>
         co=MPVolt for the company who created the game<br/>
         <br/>
         Now st=d&id=20 means st = d to delete or erase a row from database<br/>
         id identifyes the row id to delete<br/>
        <br/>
         And as a last exercide <br/>
